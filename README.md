# StreamPlay
Stream torrent files and magnet links with automatic transcoding, via a drag/drop interface, to your Apple TV.

Written in C++ with Qt, transcoding by FFmpeg.

This is (was) a commercial project that did not take off. I'm hoping someone somewhere gets some use out of it. Please let me know if you do :)

If anyone is seriously interested in helping turning this in to an awesome open source project, get in touch and/or send PRs! Otherwise, it will be largely unmaintained by me.
